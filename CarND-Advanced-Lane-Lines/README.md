## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in "advLaneFinding.ipynb".  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

I used the camera matrix and distortion coefficients from first code cell and apply them on the camera images.


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I tried multiple ways to binarize, as the accuracy was not upto mark for the bridge and the shadows frames. In the end I choose the solution which solves the problem in 2 stages. First I find the yellow lines using the fact that blue color is the least in the yellow so I find the ratio of blue channel to the max_color_value and threshold it. For the white lines, I used gradients & HLS color space.I also used another aspect that the white channel will have very low chroma content(chroma content = max(r,g,b)-min(r,g,b)). Eventually I appropriately addedup the 2 stages.  Here are examples of my output for this step.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `do_persp()`, which appears under the headline ``Perspective transformation and Inverse Transformation``.  The `do_persp()` function takes as inputs an image (img), and the Transformation matrix. The transformation matrix is generated by ``getperpcoeff()`` and ``getinvperpcoeff()`  I chose to hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
    src = np.float32([[224,690],[1078,690],[740,480],[545,480]])
    dstpts = np.float32([[300,700],[980,700],[980,250],[300,250]])
```

This is the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 224, 690      | 300, 700        | 
| 1078, 690      | 980, 700      |
| 740, 480     | 980, 250      |
| 545, 480      | 300, 250        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

I designed two line identifiers for lane-lines:
Stand-Alone Lane Detection: This function uses no prior knowledge so will work on a single Image. It first finds the base lane position at the bottom of the Image. I realized the initial code from lecture was not working well incase the broken lane-lines are close to bottom. So I changed the code to identify if a correct base position is found, otherwise it estimates it from the other lane using the Lane_Width parameter. After finding the base position, it searches up to find the lane points in the binary images by using the fact that they will be connected. Also here I made an edit that the broken lane-line can use the centroid shift from the other lane-line.

Continuous Lane Detection: This function uses prior knowledge. It uses the lane-lines detected in previous frame and then searches in its neighborhood.

Once I obtain the pixels belonging to the lane-lines, I use polytfit of 2nd order to fit the points. Here I am using a Line Class storing the poly-fit coeff,history,xpoints,ypoints,etc. In case of video, some frames are very challenging for the binarizer. For such cases we can use the prediction from the previous frame. We have to be careful not to copy for too long or else we will be be making big errors.

Everytime I make a Lane-line prediction using Continuous Lane Detection, I compare it to previous prediction and if they are similar I let it pass. In case its way off, I use the Stand-Alone Lane Detection as its slightly robust and then again do the symmetry check. If the second attempt also result in failure, I use the Lane-Line from previous frame. This usage of previous frame is limited to max 10 frames. After that we will default to Stand-Alone Lane Detection. Check ``update_lines`` function in "Line Symmetry Check" Block.

Then I average the polyfit coefficient over last 10 frames to get smooth transitions. The image on left is perspective transformed and then lane lines are fit on it.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

The code is implemented in the function ``curvature_cal`` int the "Curvature Calculation" block. It first converts the pixel coordinates to the real world scale(meters). It then fits a 2nd order polynomial to the new coordinates. Then it uses the formula for curvature described in the lecture. To find the position of the vehicle we use the midpoint of the two lane lines and the midpoint of our image. The difference of two midpoint is then converted to meters which shows if our car is deviating from the lane.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented it in the Block 'Lane Mask to plot in the frame'. The function ``get_lane_mask()`` takes the line coordinates and plot them in a mask Image. It then transform the mask image back to the original frame coordinates. Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result][video1]

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The project was very challenging in the sense that there were lot of components interacting with each other and it was hard to find the issue when running it on a video. I was having trouble with the bridge and also the shadow areas of the video using the HSV(color_range) binarization techniques. I end up using a simple blue-color absence in yellow lane heruristic. This was invariant to shadow or brightness. I also had to signifcantly change the Lane-line detection as it was not working for broken lines. I was able to fix for bad Lane-line detection using the Line Symmetry Checks and default to the previous frame prediction. This had to be tuned a lot as the video had significant variations. 
My pipeline will fail in multiple scenarios - too dark areas(tunnel), stray objects on the road, extreme turns, Lane-lines covered by hay, etc. I was able to see them in the harder challenges videos. I think lot of them can be handled by using the frame predictions effectively.Also I think the Lane-Symmetry checks function could be improved as it can handle the cases where only 1 Lane line is visible. We can also use albedo images to handle the shadows/brightness changes.
